### Why donate to Giving What We Can

Giving What We Can is an organisation at the forefront of promoting effective giving. We only recommend the most effective charities in the world. Because we help to increase the amount of people donating (and therefore the amount of money moved) to effective charities, we think that we are an extremely effective organisation to donate to.

We estimate that **for every $1 donated to us, between $6 and $60 additional dollars will be donated to effective charities**. We think this means that Giving What We Can represents a fantastic return on investment.

For more information on how we calculate these figures, you can **[download our Fundraising Prospectus](https://givingwhatwecan.org/fundraising-prospectus-2015)**. You can also head to **[givingwhatwecan.org/impact](https://givingwhatwecan.org/impact)** if you want to try out the calculation for yourself!
