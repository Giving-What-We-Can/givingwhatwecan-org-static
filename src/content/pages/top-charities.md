With people dying every day of preventable diseases and malnutrition, it is critical that we donate to the most effective charities possible. The difference between charities is astounding. Some do 1,000 times as much good with their donations as others!

We strongly recommend donating to these charities. To the best of our knowledge, based on [assessments of these charities](/about-us/how-we-assess-charities), these are the most cost-effective charities in the world:

## Well Established Charities

Our top charities deliver proven, high-impact, cost-effective interventions, and we are confident that they will continue to do so.
