Giving What We Can focuses its research on poverty relief in the developing world. We have found that [the best charities working in this area](/top-charities) are doing incredible work, and that donations to these charities can do an amazing amount of good.

However, it is plausible that there may be even more effective ways to improve the lives of others, which fall outside of the scope of our research. There’s certainly plenty of evidence that non-poverty focused interventions can achieve incredible things: Just consider the impact of the campaigns which led to women’s enfranchisement and the abolition of slavery!

Giving What We Can is interested in helping others as much as possible with our donations, and we welcome anyone who shares this goal. For this reason, our [Pledge](/get-involved/become-member) does not restrict you to developing world charities: The only requirement is that you give to the charities which you believe to be the most effective in the world.

With this in mind, here are some links to organisations which share our commitment to seeking out the most effective interventions, but which focus on areas other than poverty relief:

*   [The Open Philanthropy Project](http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes) has investigated many different causes, including action against antibiotic resistance and global catastrophic risks.
*   [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/) compares animal welfare charities and has a list of recommendations.
*   [The Copenhagen Consensus Centre](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/research-topics) has looked at and made their best attempt to compare a variety of interventions, both poverty and non-poverty related. Their [giving guide](http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/guide-giving) offers more information about their recommendations.
