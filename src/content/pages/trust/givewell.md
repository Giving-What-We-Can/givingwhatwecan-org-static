GiveWell has partnered with Giving What We Can to provide UK-taxpayers the ability to make Gift Aid-eligible donations to GiveWell's top charities. Giving What We Can will process your gift and GiveWell will receive a notification of your gift.

If you have any questions regarding the trust, please email [trust@givingwhatwecan.org](mailto:trust@givingwhatwecan.org) or [info@givewell.org](mailto:info@givewell.org).

## How does it work?

*   Fill in your details and select the charities that will receive your donations.
*   You will then be taken to a page from which you can donate to the trust by PayPal (including the option to pay by credit or debit card), or GoCardless.
*   You will also be sent an email with a link to your unique donation page in case you want to donate again in the future.
*   We will process your donation, claim gift aid on it, and send the full amount (minus processing fees) to the charities of your choice. GoCardless charges 1%, capped at Â£1.60; PayPal charges 1.4%-3.4%, uncapped.
*   If you ever want to alter your charity preferences, just email us to let us know at [trust@givingwhatwecan.org](mailto:trust@givingwhatwecan.org).

## Your Choice of Charities

You may choose to give to a single charity or to give to GiveWell for regranting to its recommended charities at its discretion. You may also specify an alternative charity allocation.

#### <a name="1"></a>Can I give to charities not on the list?

We do not currently support donations via this page to charities other than GiveWell's recommended charities.

#### <a name="4"></a>When will my donations go to my chosen charities?

By default, we pay out every quarter. However, if you have a preference for donations to be sooner or later, let us know in the text box of the sign-up form, or by emailing us at [trust@givingwhatwecan.org](mailto:trust@givingwhatwecan.org?subject=Giving%20What%20We%20Can%20Trust), and we will take reasonable steps to accommodate this.

#### <a name="5"></a>Is the trust a part of Giving What We Can?

No, the Trust is an entirely separate legal entity from Giving What We Can and the Centre for Effective Altruism. To avoid any doubt, money from the Trust will never be paid to either organisation or their affiliates.

#### <a name="6"></a>Who runs the trust?

The trustees are Michelle Hutchinson (Executive Director of Giving What We Can), Andreas Mogensen (Assistant Executive Director of Giving What We Can) and Alison Woodman (Trust Treasurer).

#### <a name="7"></a>What will my data be used for?

We will use your data to link it with donations to the Trust, so we can claim Gift Aid on it and direct donations to the charities of your choice. GiveWell will receive notification of your gift. Giving What We Can will use your data for donor statistics and for no other purpose.
