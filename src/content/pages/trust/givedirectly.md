Giving What We Can provides UK taxpayers the ability to make Gift Aid-eligible donations to GiveDirectly as one of GiveWell's top charities. Giving What We Can will process your gift and pass it on to GiveDirectly.

If you have any questions regarding the trust, please email [trust@givingwhatwecan.org](mailto:trust@givingwhatwecan.org) or [info@givedirectly.org](mailto:info@givedirectly.org).

## How does it work?

*   Fill in and submit your details.
*   You will then be taken to a page from which you can donate to the trust by PayPal (including the option to pay by credit or debit card), or GoCardless.
*   You will also be sent an email with a link to your unique donation page in case you want to donate again in the future.
*   We will process your donation, claim gift aid on it, and send the full amount (minus processing fees) to GiveDirectly. GoCardless charges 1%, capped at Â£1.60; PayPal charges 1.4%-3.4%, uncapped.

[What will my data be used for?](#7)

#### <a name="4"></a>When will my donations go to GiveDirectly?

By default, we pay out every quarter. However, if you have a preference for donations to be sooner or later, let us know by emailing us at [trust@givingwhatwecan.org](mailto:trust@givingwhatwecan.org?subject=Giving%20What%20We%20Can%20Trust), and we will take reasonable steps to accommodate this.

#### <a name="5"></a>Is the trust a part of Giving What We Can?

No, the Trust is an entirely separate legal entity from Giving What We Can and the Centre for Effective Altruism. To avoid any doubt, money from the Trust will never be paid to either organisation or their affiliates.

#### <a name="6"></a>Who runs the trust?

The trustees are Michelle Hutchinson (Executive Director of Giving What We Can), Andreas Mogensen (Assistant Executive Director of Giving What We Can) and Alison Woodman (Trust Treasurer).

#### <a name="7"></a>What will my data be used for?

We will use your data to link it with donations to the Trust, so we can claim Gift Aid on it. GiveDirectly will be notified of your details if you provide your consent. Giving What We Can will use your data for donor statistics and for no other purpose.
