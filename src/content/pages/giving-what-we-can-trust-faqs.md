To help you get your money to the most effective charities, Giving What We Can have set up a [charitable trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_trusts_in_English_law) in the UK. What’s more, you don’t even have to be a member to use it!

You can register on our [sign-up page](/trust). Filling in the form does not commit you to giving any money to the Trust.

### Why a charitable trust?

Donating to charities via the Trust has a number of benefits:

*   If you are based in the UK, you can get gift aid on charities which do not have a UK base, such as [Project Healthy Children](/top-charities/project-healthy-children).
*   You can set up recurring payments to a number of our [recommended charities](/top-charities) in one go.
*   You won’t need to keep track of changes to our recommendations: If (and only if) you ask us to, we can automatically change the destination of your money if our recommended charities change.
*   The Trust helps us to keep better track of the donations we inspire and the good we do, helping us to raise our profile and get new members.

### How does it work?

Using the Trust couldn’t be simpler:

*   On the [sign-up page](/trust), fill in your details and tick the charities which will receive your donations. You will be sent an email with your unique GivingID, so you can sign in using this and your password.
*   Once you are signed in, you can donate by Gocardless, Paypal or bank transfer.
*   We process your donation, claim gift aid on it, and send the full amount (less transaction fees from GoCardless or Paypal) to the charities of your choice. Unless you give us permission, we will never give the money to a charity you have not chosen without first checking with you.
*   If you ever want to alter your charity preferences, just email us to let us know at trust@givingwhatwecan.org.

### <a name="1"></a>Can I split my donations in any proportion?

Absolutely. Although the default is for donations to be split equally, we can split them in a any proportion. Just make this clear in the text box on the [sign-up page](/trust) or, if you forget, email us at trust@givingwhatwecan.org.

### <a name="2"></a>Where can I donate?

You can donate to any of our currently recommended charities through the main Trust form [here](/trust). At present these are Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Deworm the World Initiative and Project Healthy Children.

You can also use the Trust to donate to GiveDirectly [here](/trust/givedirectly), Development Media International [here](/trust/dmi) and Innovations for Poverty Action [here.](/trust/ipa)

### <a name="3"></a>Can I give to the Trust if I'm not from the UK?

Yes, but the benefits will be fewer, as only UK citizens can claim tax relief on their donations. We are considering setting up a Donor Advised Fund in the U.S. in the future.

### <a name="4"></a>Which is the best way of giving to the Trust?

We prefer donations via Gocardless as this service has a good balance between a low fee (1%, capped at £1.60) and easy administration for us. Paypal is an alternative if you want to use a card to donate, but has slightly more expensive fees (1.4% + 20p, uncapped). Bank transfers and cheques have no fee, but they impose more administrative costs - we recommend them only for large, infrequent donations.

### <a name="5"></a>When will my donations go to my chosen charities?

By default, we pay out every quarter. However, if you have a preference for donations to be sooner or later, let us know by emailing us at [trust@givingwhatwecan.org](mailto:trust@givingwhatwecan.org), and we will take reasonable steps to accommodate this.

### <a name="6"></a>Is the Trust a part of Giving What We Can?

No, the Trust is an entirely separate legal entity from Giving What We Can and the Centre for Effective Altruism. To avoid any doubt, money from the Trust will never be paid to either organisation or their affiliates.

### <a name="7"></a>Who runs the Trust?

The trustees are Michelle Hutchinson (Executive Director of Giving What We Can), Alison Woodman (Director of Community at Giving What We Can) and Jonathan Courtney (Director of Outreach at Giving What We Can).

### <a name="8"></a>What will my data be used for?

We will use your data to link it with donations to the Trust, so we can claim Gift Aid on it and direct donations to the charities of your choice. If you are a Giving What We Can member we may use it in our annual Giving Review. We may also use anonymised, aggregated data about the size of donations to our charities in our public materials. We will ask you about any further uses of your data.

### <a name="9"></a>Can I give to the Trust in my will?

Yes, and we will make sure that the money always goes to the most cost-effective charities we can find, even if those charities change. Please email us at trust@givingwhatwecan.org if you are thinking of doing this.

### <a name="11"></a>Is this connected to the Pledge?

No, the Trust is just an option for way of donating, while the Pledge is a commitment to give a proportion of your income. The Trust can help you fulfil your Pledge, but non-members can use the Trust as well. Members are not obliged to give through the Trust, and can donate to other charities they believe to be effective if they wish.

### <a name="12"></a>Can I donate through Payroll Giving?

Yes, the Trust is registered with all of the UK’s main Payroll Giving Agencies. You may need the following details to set up your donation:

Charity number: 1155773
Charity address: Giving What We Can Trust, 6 Temple Mews, 6 Temple Road, Oxford, OX4 2DY

When you fill out your Payroll Giving application, please try to include an indication of which charities you would like us to direct your donation towards. If the application does not allow space for this, please email trust@givingwhatwecan.org.
