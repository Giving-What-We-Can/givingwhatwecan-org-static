When donating to any of our four recommended charities, many Canadian donors will be able to claim back a significant portion of their donation that would otherwise be taxed. The money that can be claimed from a tax deductible donation will enable you to be more generous than you initially thought.

## How do I claim my tax deduction?

You claim tax credits by including your charitable donations in Schedule 9 of your tax return. This can be found [here](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/5000-s9/5000-s9-12e.pdf)

If you fill out a paper tax return, submit the donation receipts along with Schedule 9\. You will be provided with these by the organisations you donate to or through, if they have tax deductibility arrangements in place. If you file the tax return electronically, keep hold of the receipts for 5 years in case the Canada Revue Agency asks to see them. More information can be found [here](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/dnrs/svngs/clmng2-eng.html)

## How do I claim my tax deduction from donations to your recommended charities?

### Against Malaria Foundation

AMF is a registered Canadian charity so tax can be claimed back by the process outlined above.

### Schistosomiasis Control Initiative

SCI is not a registered Canadian charity but all donations are made to it through the Worldpay facility. The Worldpay facility can be found by clicking the "donate now" button on the SCI homepage: [www.schisto.org](http://www.schisto.org). Worldpay facility payments are made through the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine which is a "qualified donee" in Canada. This means receipts for such donations should be acceptable to the Canadian tax authority.

Alternatively, Canadian donors can make a transfer to SCI via the Imperial College bank account, which should also be tax-deductible. To ensure the money gets directed to SCI, it is important that donors put "Donation to SCI, Professor Alan Fenwick" in the reference section on each transfer. These are the bank account details for Worldpay:

Bank: Natwest
 Address: South Kensington Station Branch, 18 Cromwell Place, London SW7 2LB, England.
Sort code: 51-50-01
Account No. 00600032
Swift code: NWBK GB 2L
IBAN: GB67NWBK51500100600032

### Project Healthy Children and Deworm the World

Project Healthy Children and Deworm the World are not registered Canadian charities. Donations to either charity of under $1,000 CAD would not be tax-deductible. Donations of $1,000 CAD or more would be tax deductible if they are made through the Tides Canada Foundation as one-time grant recommendations. Tides Canada would provide the donor with a Canadian tax receipt and charge the charity that the grant is given to 10% of the donation and a $50 fee. More information about this can be found [here](http://tidescanada.org/give-internationally/canadian-donors/)

## How much can I claim back?

[This website](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/dnrs/svngs/clmng1b2-eng.html) will calculate the amount that you can claim back from your donation.

Notably, once the amount you have donated to registered charities over the year exceeds $200 CAD, both the federal and provincial charitable tax credit rates increase substantially. Further, from March 2013 (until 2017) if neither you nor your spouse/partner has claimed charitable tax credit from the Canadian government in the last 5 years, your tax credit rate for your donations (up to $1,000 CAD) may be increased by an additional 25%.
