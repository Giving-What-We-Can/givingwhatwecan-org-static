## Against Malaria Foundation

The Against Malaria Foundation is a registered charity in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands and the UK. This means donors from any of these countries are able to benefit from national tax benefits for their charitable contributions to AMF.

### Donating to Against Malaria Foundation from a country not listed above, or donating to Schistosomiasis Control Initiative from outside of the UK

Following a [ruling by the European Courts of Justice](http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/news/private-client/charities/gifts-foreign-charities-are-tax-deductible-ecj-rules), tax relief should be available to charities across the EU. If you live in one EU country and donate to a charity registered in another EU country you may be able to claim tax back.

However, this ruling does not mean that you can guarantee a tax deduction for giving to **SCI**, **AMF** or any other EU-based charity simply because the charity is registered in an EU member state. Member states have amended their legislation to comply with European Courts of Justice ruling to _varying_ degrees. You must check the amendments of your country's national tax laws regarding charitable donations.

Even if you think that the charity you are donating to meets the requirements of your country's amended tax-deductibility laws, you (and the charity) will have to convince the tax authorities of this before you can claim a tax deduction.

### What are my alternatives?

If you are unlikely to be successful in claiming tax deductibility, or you would rather not engage in the bureaucracy involved in convincing your tax authorities, you can still make a tax-deductible donation through **Transnational Giving Europe (TGE)**. In order to do so, you would need to ask your chosen charity to apply to your country's TGE partner foundation in order to become affiliated with TGE. TGE takes 5% of your donation to cover its costs.

## Project Healthy Children and Deworm the World

Project Healthy Children and Deworm the World do not have tax-deductible arrangements for EU donors.
