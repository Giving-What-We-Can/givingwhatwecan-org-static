## Can I claim tax back on your recommended charities?

Yes! The [Against Malaria Foundation](/top-charities/against-malaria) has [recently had their Deductible Gift Recipient status approved](https://www.againstmalaria.com/NewsItem.aspx?newsitem=AMF-(Australia)-granted-DGR-status-(tax-deductibility-for-donors)), meaning they are now tax deductible in Australia. Donations made on or after 4 August 2015 are eligible to be deducted from your taxable income.

Unfortunately, none of our other three recommended charities are currently tax deductible in Australia (DGRs) and this may be something to take into account when choosing a charity to give to. More information on DGR status can be found [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Non-profit/Gifts-and-fundraising/Deductible-gift-recipients/)

## For individual donors

If you would like to discuss whether giving to our recommended charities would be an effective donation, please [get in touch](mailto:information@givingwhatwecan.org) and we would be happy to advise you.
