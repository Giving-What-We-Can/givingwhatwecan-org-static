If you are German, then donations of up to 20% of your annual income can be claimed as tax-exempt (donations of over 20% can be carried into the next fiscal year). The money that can be claimed from a tax deductible donation may enable you to be more generous than you initially thought.

## How do I claim tax reduction?

In order to claim a tax-deductible donation on your tax return, you will need a donation receipt from the charity you have given to and either a cash payment receipt or payment confirmation from the bank. Importantly, the charity's receipt must be issued using an official template which can be found [here.](http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Downloads/BMF_Schreiben/Steuerarten/Einkommensteuer/2012-08-30-zuwendungsbestaetigungen.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4)
