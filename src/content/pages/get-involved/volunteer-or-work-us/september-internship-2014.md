##### Parking in Oxford

Many Oxford streets are now closed to traffic and parking is severely limited. Visitors are encouraged to use the Park and Ride bus services which operate between the city centre and parking areas on the outskirts at Pear Tree, Woodstock Road (north); Water Eaton (north); Seacourt, Botley Road (west); Redbridge, Abingdon Road (south); and Thornhill, London Road (east).
Please note that Thornhill and Seacourt are often full, particularly on University Open Days. We therefore recommend that drivers coming to Oxford from the east (including London), the south and the west use the Redbridge Park & Ride, while drivers arriving from the north can choose between Pear Tree and Water Eaton.

##### Taxis

Taxi ranks are located at Oxford Railway Station, Gloucester Green Coach Station and St Giles' in the city centre.
A list of taxi companies can be found on the Tourist Information Centre website.Oxford is about 60 miles (90 kms) northwest of London and has excellent road and national rail links. Regular coach services connect Oxford with the capital and also with Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton airports.
