Chapters are one of the most important parts of Giving What We Can’s efforts to reach out to new people, and introduce them to our ideas of pledging and effective giving. They’re also the bedrock of Giving What We Can’s worldwide community, which helps members stay motivated and committed to their pledge to give!

If you’re running a Giving What We Can chapter, or you’d like to start one in your city or university, we’ve got a great set of resources to help you get started

The starter pack gives you a comprehensive overview of how to start a chapter, and is the first thing you should read before you begin.
