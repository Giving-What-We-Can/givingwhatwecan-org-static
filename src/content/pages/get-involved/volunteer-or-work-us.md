Over the last few years, we have grown to members in over 40 countries worldwide and have received wide press coverage throughout Europe and North America.

We're now looking to step up our efforts. We're looking to build a dynamic, inspiring team of employees and graduate volunteers to help spread the word, grow the community and produce rock-solid research.

Based in offices shared with the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, you'll be part of a team that dedicates itself to understanding how we can do the most good - and actually delivering on those ideas.

## Current Opportunities <small>(September 2015</small>

We are currently seeking candidates for the following roles.

*   [Giving What We Can: Director of Growth](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers/giving-what-we-can-director-of-growth)
*   [Giving What We Can: Research Analyst](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers/giving-what-we-can-research-analyst)

Please follow the links above to the position descriptions on the [careers section of the Centre for Effective Altruism website](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers).

_Please note: Applications close October 18th at 11:59pm, Oxford Time_

## Graduate volunteer positions

### Oxford-based

**Please note that we have filled all of our Oxford-based Graduate volunteer positions for the Summer of 2015\. Please feel free to apply for October 2015 onwards.**

We are recruiting for people to volunteer with us full-time in Oxford on an expenses-only basis. We run a Graduate Volunteer Scheme for people who want to stay with us for around eight to ten months, and also offer short-term internships, which generally last at least three months.

The scheme has proved very popular with our current interns, with many repeatedly extending their time with us. We provide a stimulating and dedicated atmosphere in the office and a lively and welcoming community outside office hours. If you would like to discuss what it’s like to work here, we’d be happy to put you in touch with a current volunteer.

We are sometimes able to provide accommodation in a house with other volunteers and staff, and expenses of up to £10 a day based on financial need. However it may improve your chances of being offered an internship if you can secure your own funding to cover expenses, for example through scholarships and fundraising.

### Remote working

We are also always happy to receive applications from people who wish to volunteer remotely. Though we don’t have a formal scheme in place, please get in touch with us if you are interested and we will see what we can put in place.
