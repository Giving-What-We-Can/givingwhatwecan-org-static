# Join a Local Chapter

Now in our fifth year, Giving What We Can has established chapters in Europe, the US and Australia, with many more soon to come. Each local chapter brings together like-minded people for talks and discussions (which are generally open to the public), activism and social events.

Our goal is to create a global network of people working to promote the goals of Giving What We Can:

*   Spreading the view that global poverty is one of the world's greatest problems
*   Encouraging people to give a portion of their income to the most cost-effective charities in the world.

* * *

We have a [chapter starter packet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxN9jkWGI8LFblFKakNrQU1Felk) to guide you through the process.
