The first step to becoming a Giving What We Can member is to take our pledge, making a solemn commitment to giving at least 10% of your income to the organisations that you think can do the _most_ good with it.

### The Pledge To Give:

> _“I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.”_
