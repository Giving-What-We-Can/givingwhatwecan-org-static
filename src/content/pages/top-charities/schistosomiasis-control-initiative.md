Schistosomiasis Control Initiative was founded in 2002\. It works in sub-Saharan Africa to supply drugs and health education to protect against schistosomiasis (bilharzia) and other [Neglected Tropical Diseases](/research/charities-area/neglected-tropical-diseases-ntds) caused by intestinal worms.

## How it works

*   SCI conducts surveys of countries and constructs “risk-maps” which show predicted infection levels.
*   Using this data it is able to target treatment at areas where it is most needed and to calculate the drugs, equipment and staff necessary.
*   It procures drugs like praziquantel and albendazole from the World Health Organisation, and assists and supports local health authorities to distribute the drugs to schools.
*   At the same time, it supports intensive health education in schools and communities.It supports research to evaluate the impact of its interventions, and makes its results available to all.

## Why we recommend it

SCI is one of [a very few](/top-charities/deworm-world) charities which focus exclusively on [Neglected Tropical Diseases](/research/charities-area/neglected-tropical-diseases-ntds). NTDs are so-called because treatment is cheap and effective, but chronically underfunded due to lack of publicity (and therefore donations).

It has a strong track record, and its cost-effectiveness is so high that it has been designated a “best buy” in public health by the World Health Organisation. The cost per treatment is around $1.23.

It is staffed largely by academics who are experts in the field, and it uses its impact surveys and detailed self-evaluations to learn and improve its methods. With further donations it will extend its operations, including to new countries like Zimbabwe.

## Case study: Distribution in Butiaba, Uganda

*   Uganda has long had a serious problem with schistosomiasis. Along with persistent diarrhoea, those inflicted suffer severe liver and spleen disease. This leads to serious bleeding through the mouth and nose, and sometimes death.
*   The village of Butiaba was one community devastated by the disease, which was a leading cause of hospital deaths in the area.
*   In 2003 SCI began providing the drugs and logistics for a mass treatment campaign for all communities at risk in the country, along with intensive health education.
*   At the same time it supported research to evaluate the impact of its activities, considering a cohort in Butiaba in 2003 and again in 2010.
*   The results showed a marked reduction in both the incidence and severity of liver disease, and many people making full recoveries.
