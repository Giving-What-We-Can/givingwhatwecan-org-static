This page contains essays by our founders and staff on the theory behind charitable giving, and effective giving in particular. They cover issues such as the dramatic difference in cost-effectiveness between world charities and the imperative to choose carefully before making donations. More broadly, they also focus on the psychology of giving and how it can improve happiness levels, and considerations about the most effective time to make donations.
