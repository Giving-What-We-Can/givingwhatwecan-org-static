A massive 350â€“500 million people contract malaria every year. Fortunately, there are highly cost-effective means of tackling the disease, especially preventative measures such as bednets, which can be supplied cheaply. We particularly recommend the Against Malaria Foundation.

Malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted via the saliva of infected mosquitoes. When the mosquitoes bite, the parasites are transported through the human body to the liver, where they multiply and infect the red blood cells.

Symptoms of malaria include fever, headache, and vomiting, and usually appear between 10 and 15 days after the mosquito bite. If untreated, malaria can quickly become life-threatening as it disrupts the blood supply to vital organs. In many parts of the world, the parasites have developed resistance to a number of antimalarial drugs.[1]

Each year, 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. More than one million people die from malaria each year.

## Cost-effectiveness

Key interventions to control malaria include: prompt and effective treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies, use of insecticidal nets by people at risk, and indoor residual spraying with insecticide to control the vector mosquitoes.

Charities that focus on malaria often advertise their cost-effectiveness in terms of how much it costs to purchase and distribute one insecticide-treated bednet.

Malaria interventions can be very cost-effective. The against Malaria foundation distributes long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito net for about $6 per net. According to some calculations, it only costs about $3,340 to enable 34 years of healthy life that would otherwise been lost. This is equivalent to saving a life.

## Other information

### Are there side effects?

One possible negative side effect is:

*   Malaria develops resistance to drug treatment. However, this resistance is taken into account in the above cost-effectiveness estimates for household spraying and case management.

## Conclusion

Tackling malaria is a highly cost-effective intervention in the developing world. Of the many malaria charities, we can particularly recommend [Against Malaria Foundation](/top-charities/against-malaria-foundation). Please see our page of [Recommended Charities](/top-charities) for more information.
