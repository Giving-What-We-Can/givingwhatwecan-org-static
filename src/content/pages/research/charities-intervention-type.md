There are a number of ways in which charities fight the causes and effects of extreme poverty. Below are pages on many of the major types of intervention carried out in the developing world. These pages summarise how these interventions work, and the conclusions of our research into their effectiveness. See also our page on [How We Assess Charities](/about-us/how-we-assess-charities).

So far our research has especially focused on evaluating health-related organisations, because there are comprehensive statistics and data available for assessing their cost-effectiveness, and because our research shows that the most effective aid interventions are likely to be health-focused.

We owe a lot to our high quality sources. Our biggest source of information, particularly for determining our charity recommendations, is the US charity evaluator [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/). Their rigorous research methodology focused on determining the overall good done by programs, combined with a strong commitment to transparency and the resources to investigate charities extremely thoroughly, make them an invaluable resource for determining the best charities to donate to.

Our reports also draw on a number of primary sources, among which are:

*   [The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/) – An excellent source of randomized control trial data on interventions designed to alleviate poverty.
*   [The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries Report (DCP2)](http://www.dcp2.org/main/Home.html) – This provides cost effectiveness data on a wide range of health interventions in the developing world.
*   [The World Health Organisation WHO-CHOICE guide](http://www.who.int/choice/en/) – A cost-effectiveness report similar in scope to DCP2.
