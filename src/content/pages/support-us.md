If you are looking to donate to our top charities: [Top Charities](/top-charities)

Although we primarily encourage our members and the public to donate to the charities we have found to be the most effective in the world, we do need funding ourselves in order to promote this message, and donations are appreciated.

## Our Impact

We estimate that for every dollar donated to Giving What We Can, between **$6 and $60 will be donated to highly effective charities**.

### COST-EFFECTIVENESS

Given the importance of cost-effectiveness to our mission, we have assessed the effectiveness of donations given to us. According to our best estimates, every $1 invested in Giving What We Can will generate around $60 for the best charities. If you want to see our calculations, please have a look at our [Impact page](/impact), or email [information@givingwhatwecan.org](mailto:information@givingwhatwecan.org).

Most of our current expenditure is on staff, as Giving What We can is beyond the size where it could be run well on a volunteer-only basis.

### CAN DONATING TO GIVING WHAT WE CAN FULFIL PART OF THE 10% PLEDGE?

We do allow donations to Giving What We Can to be part of the 10% pledge, although members are in no way expected to donate to us, and we encourage those who do so to give to other charities as well.
