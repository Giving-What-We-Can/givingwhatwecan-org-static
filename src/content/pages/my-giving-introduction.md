My Giving is an excellent tool for motivating yourself to giveâ€”and keep giving. By entering your income and the amount you have given, My Giving will display your giving record, and the percentage of your income you have donated. Whatever the size of your giving ambitions, you can use this feature to track and achieve them.

Donations are ordered by time, so you can see when you have given, and if you are on track with your giving goals. The best way to achieve these is to regularly review your giving record, and plan your next donations, making sure you have the impact you want to have.
