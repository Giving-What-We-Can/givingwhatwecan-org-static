## Privacy statement

Giving What We Can respects your right to privacy and believes you have the right to control the use of your personal information. The privacy statement sets out how we go about collecting data, what data we collect, why we collect it and how it is used. The information collected is used to provide and improve services.

Giving What We Can will only collect information about you which is necessary in order to provide the service you have requested. Data is fairly processed according to the data protection principles and will not be kept for longer than necessary to provide the services you have requested. Any data stored will be securely password protected, and not accessible by any any third parties.

## When and why we collect information about you

To facilitate Giving What We Can membership, Try Giving and the My Giving accounts, we need to store personal details. Any information collected will be used only for the service you have requested and similar services. You can choose to unsubscribe from these services at any time.

We typically publish the name and occupation of our members on our website. However, we realise that many desire to give anonymously and we respect this wish. Please let us know on your completed membership application form if you wish to remain anonymous and we will not publish your name and occupation.

## Email subscribers

When you sign up to our email alerts we store the data you give us. This is recorded to our own customer relationship software, which is password protected, and is not accessible by any third parties.

You can unsubscribe at any time. To ensure we are giving the highest quality of service we may ask your reason for unsubscribing but you can refuse to answer. If you request it, we will delete your information completely from our database. We cannot, however, guarantee that it will be deleted from all backups.

## Website visitors

### Links

[www.givingwhatwecan.org](/) has links to other websites. Giving What We Can is not responsible for the content of those sites or how they process any personal information you provide.

### Web Server Log Files

We collect data about website visitors in web server log files including IP address and ISP (internet service provider). We only use these records for administration; it is typically hard to tie to a single individual without extensive resources and we never attempt to do so. You can avoid us and other websites logging your personal IP address by using a VPN service.

### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to help analyse use of our website by collecting anonymous visitor behaviour information. This information is transmitted to Google. You can see Google's privacy policy at: [http://www.google.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html](http://www.google.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html) You can opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites at: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### ShareThis

We use ShareThis to provide an easy way for you to share links to our articles on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and StumbleUpon. You can read the ShareThis privacy policy and opt out at: [http://sharethis.com/privacy](http://sharethis.com/privacy).

You can use a browser plugin like Ghostery [http://www.ghostery.com/](http://www.ghostery.com/) should you wish to block any or all of the cookies we employ.

### Cookies
