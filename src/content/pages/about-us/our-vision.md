## Our Vision:

**A world without extreme poverty**

## Our Mission:

**Inspire donations to the world's most effective charities**

## Our Mission Statement

We believe that people in the developed world have an amazing opportunity to substantially improve the lives of countless people at the other end of the global income scale. Our members pledge to give at least 10% of their income to the organisations which can do the most good with their donations. We use evidence to identify those organisations and share our findings. By forming a global community and making public our commitment to effective giving, we can inspire others and ensure that we make a real impact on global poverty.
