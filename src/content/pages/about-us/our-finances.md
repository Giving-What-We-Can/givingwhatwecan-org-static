This page contains our accounts and budget, which we make publicly available as part of our commitment to transparency.

Here is a high-level version of our current budget (note that we typically spend slightly less money than budgeted):

The accounts of the Centre for Effective Altruism, our parent charity, are [available here](/files/cea_annual_accounts_2013.pdf) (along with the accompanying [narrative pages](/files/cea_annual_accounts_2013_-_narrative_pages.pdf)). These accounts show all spending by CEA, not just that for Giving What We Can. They cover our first fiscal year (23rd February 2012 to 30th June 2013), which began on the date on which we were incorporated; however, we only began to operate and spend money in July 2012, so in practice they cover spending for one calendar year. They were approved by an independent examiner, who inspected our financial records. Details of what we spent money on are given in notes 3 and 11 of the accounts, but we give a more detailed summary of this (with a fuller and more accurate attribution of costs) below:

Note that these figures count 'charges on donations' (e.g. fees that we have to pay to take tax-deductible donations from the US) as spending.
