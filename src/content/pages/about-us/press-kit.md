You can use our [income calculator](/get-involved/how-rich-am-i) to work out how someone's income compares to the rest of the world, and what the impact of taking our pledge would be (e.g. using [the UK median income](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i?country=GBR&income=21000&adults=1&children=0) or [the US median income](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i?country=USA&income=28155&adults=1&children=0)).
