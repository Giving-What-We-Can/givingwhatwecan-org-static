## List of members

We hope others will [join us](/get-involved/join-us), adding their names to this list and working together to help others in the most effective ways we can.

**A note to charities**: we ask our members to publicly list their names in order to display their commitment to eradicating extreme poverty and helping others, and this list must not be used to approach our members for funding purposes. Requests should instead be sent directly to [Giving What We Can](mailto:information@givingwhatwecan.org), where we will respond with an appraisal of your case.
