### Our Vision

**A world without extreme poverty**

Giving What We Can is an international society dedicated to eliminating extreme poverty in the developing world. [Extreme poverty is one of the biggest problems in the world today,](/get-involved/why-get-involved) and we are determined to do something about it.

### Our Mission

**Inspire donations to the world’s most effective charities**

We believe that charitable donations can do an incredible amount of good. However, it all depends on the [effectiveness](/about-us/how-we-assess-charities) of the charities which receive your donations. It turns out that the difference between charities is astounding: Some do 1,000 times as much good with a donation as others! It is therefore critical that we give our money to the most effective charities, so that it will have the greatest impact possible.

To that end, Giving What We Can [recommends charities](/top-charities) based on in-depth research into the effectiveness of interventions in the developing world.

### Our Mission Statement

**We believe that people in the developed world have an amazing opportunity to substantially improve the lives of countless people at the other end of the global income scale. Our members pledge to give at least 10% of their income to the organisations which can do the most good with their donations. We use evidence to identify those organisations and share our findings. By forming a global community and making public our commitment to effective giving, we can inspire others and ensure that we make a real impact on global poverty.**

For those of us living in the developed world, our comparative wealth gives us an amazing opportunity to make a real difference. That is why our members [take a pledge](/get-involved/join-us) committing them to donate at least 10% of their incomes to the most effective charities in the world.
