# [We are a global community.](/about-us/people)

We’re not just another charity. For one thing, we don’t want your money. We’re a global community of people committed to giving part of our income in the most effective way possible.

# [We are evidence-based.](/top-charities)

We recommend the most effective charities working to help people in developing countries. The best research in effectiveness can help you to make the biggest possible difference with your money.

# [We give what we can.](/get-involved/join-us)

Our members give at least 10% of their income to the most effective charities. Together, we can eliminate extreme poverty within this lifetime.
