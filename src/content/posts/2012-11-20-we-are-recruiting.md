If you've ever thought about working for Giving What We Can, now's your chance! We're looking for full-time staff and interns to help us grow GWWC and continue researching the most important issues in fighting global poverty.

We're hoping to hire a Head of Communications and/or a Head of Fundraising and External Relations. We're also looking for anyone with an interest in working or interning for us and valuable skills. To find out more, [click here](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/jobs-available).

The first stage of the recruitment process is specially designed to be really quick- you'll fill in a little bit of basic information and then answer one question in 200 words or less. Everyone we've tested the question on thought it was pretty fun - although it does take a bit of serious thinking.

Our sister organisations are also recruiting. 80,000 Hours is looking for a Head of Career Research and Advice. Effective Animal Activism is looking for an Executive Director. The Life You Can Save is looking for a Director of Outreach. For more information on these other roles [click here](http://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/recruitment/cea-jobs.pdf).

If you have any questions, email recruitment@centreforeffectivealtruism.org

**Please note that the recruitment deadline has now passed.** There is no deadline for [internships](http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/intern) but if you apply early you will maximise your chances.
