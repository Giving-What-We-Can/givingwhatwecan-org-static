![](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8183/8101187823_18e2a8b98a_n.jpg "Hyde Park")If you're in London this weekend, don't miss the [Big IF](http://enoughfoodif.org/home), the Enough Food If campaign's rally in Hyde Park on 8 June.

On the same day as the PM holds the International Hunger Summit, you can take part in the rally and demand action on hunger from the G8.

According to the organisers, the line-up will include effectiveness pin-up and [reddit-favourite](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/) Bill Gates, the outspoken former head of the Church of England, Rowan Williams, and other celebrities from sport and TV.

We've previously published posts (start [here](http://givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-04-09/is-it-good-to-campaign-for-increased-government-aid-to-cost-effective-interventions)) on the effectiveness of campaigning for increased aid - we're pretty uncertain of its value - but the Enough Food If campaign is also about governance issues: land, tax and transparency. It's an interesting example of hundreds of NGOs coming together on one campaign platform - last seen on this scale in the [Make Poverty History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_poverty_history) movement.

Whatever its effectiveness, the rally at least promises to be an inspiring way to spend a sunny Saturday. There's another rally in Belfast on 15 June. This is all timed to coincide with the UK Government's hosting of the [2013 G8 Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/g8-2013) in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland on 17-18 June, which Prime Minister Cameron has said will focus on tax, transparency and trade.

If you do go check out the rally, let us know how it went down!
