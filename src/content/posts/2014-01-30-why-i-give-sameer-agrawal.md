![](/images/uploads/sameer_agrawal_copy.jpg)I've always been interested in having a positive impact with my career. During several trips to the developing world, I witnessed extreme poverty first-hand which has inspired me to help others. I know what good fortune is, I feel privileged, and am looking for ways to start giving something back.

Donating to charity has always interested me, but I only pledged to give away a substantial portion of my income after discovering Giving What We Can. I've been a member since October 2013, having been inspired by close friends who decided to make the step to signing the [Pledge](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/the-pledge).

Many feel that taking the Pledge involves a large personal sacrifice. But I want to remind people of the relatively comfortable position in which most of us live. More than six million children die each year from preventable diseases, and over one billion people lack access to clean drinking water. Donating ten per cent of our incomes can allow us to save lives with money that we otherwise might well spend on items that fail to bring us happiness or fulfilment. It is also widely acknowledged that donating to charity can significantly increase your happiness.

But why sign Giving What We Can's pledge in particular? By giving to the most cost-effective charities we can be certain that the money we donate is making a sizeable difference. Having made the decision to give away a portion of my income, I want that money to be used in the most effective way possible. I would not be able to donate 100x more, but I can make sure, with relatively little effort, that I donate 100x more effectively. We should all be focused not on the sacrifices we are making, but on the impact that our actions actually have.

By making public my commitment to donate ten per cent of my salary, I can hopefully convince others that it's a small step, and that they can do a similar amount of good themselves. We don't need to wait for someone else to sort out the inequalities of the world - each one of us can start to make a difference now.
