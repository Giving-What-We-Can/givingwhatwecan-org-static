This summer, there will be [a conference on effective altruism](http://www.gooddoneright.com/) at All Souls College, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford. We’re very pleased to announce that registration for the conference is now open. The conference will be from the 7th to the 9th of July. It seeks to bring together leading thinkers to address issues related to effective altruism in a shared setting. Speakers will include Derek Parfit (Oxford), Thomas Pogge (Yale), Rachel Glennerster (MIT Poverty Action Lab), Nick Bostrom (Oxford), Norman Daniels (Harvard), Toby Ord (Oxford), Jeremy Lauer (WHO), William MacAskill (Cambridge), Larissa MacFarquhar (the New Yorker), Nick Beckstead (Oxford), and Owen Cotton-Barratt (Oxford). The speakers are drawn primarily from within moral philosophy, but there will also be academics who specialize in development and health economics. There will also be a conference dinner on the 8th in the Hall at All Souls. You can learn more about the conference at [www.gooddoneright.com](url) , which also contains instructions for how to register and suggestions for finding accommodation. We very much hope to see you at the event.
