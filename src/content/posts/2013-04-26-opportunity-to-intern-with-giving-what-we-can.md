![Job at Giving What We Can](/images/uploads/for-tom-blog-cea-office-first-day.jpg)_Recruiting now; apply by 9am (UK time) on Thursday the 16th of May._

If you're here, you probably have a good idea of what Giving What We Can is about. Our mission is to find the charities which most effectively help those living in poverty and move as much money to them as possible, in part by encouraging people to pledge to donate 10% of their lifetime income to this end. That's a big project, and we're growing fast. To support this growth we now need someone to help manage our finances and fundraising, so if you'd like to join the team this is your chance!

The position we're recruiting for is Finance and Fundraising Manager. In this role, you would work closely with the director of our Operations division, which supports the different organisations within the Centre for Effective Altruism, including Giving What We Can and our sister charity [80,000 Hours](http://80000hours.org/). If you work for us you'll be part of a focused team of intelligent, enthusiastic, driven colleagues. Everyone involved in CEA is passionate about their work, making the office an inspiring place to be.

The current Finance and Fundraising intern has helped to write budgets, set up a new charity in the US, and create financial procedures and book-keeping systems almost from scratch. In doing so, he's made a major difference to the success of Giving What We Can and the Centre for Effective Altruism family that it belongs to. If you follow him, you would do so too.

We're looking for someone who can start soon, and ideally commit to at least six months, though we're flexible about time commitment. To find out more about this opportunity, please see our **[recruitment page](http://givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/work-with-us)**. If you're interested in the position, we invite you to **[fill in the short application form](http://bit.ly/15EGoWr)** - the deadline for this is **9am (UK time) on** **Thursday the 16th of May**. And if you know anyone else who you think might be keen on this role, do share this blog post with them.
