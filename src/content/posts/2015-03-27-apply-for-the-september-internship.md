Are you a student or recent graduate who is interested at interning at Giving What We Can? Are you free from the 14th to the 25th of September? If you answered yes to both of these questions you are in luck, Giving What We Can is running our September Internship program again this year and we are looking for applicants.

The internship involves working at the Centre for Effective Altruism's offices in Oxford for two weeks. Successful applicants will get to work alongside 10 to 15 other interns, networking and working on exciting projects focused on the growth and improvement of Giving What We Can. Projects include working on Giving What We Canâ€™s outreach strategy, improving our social media presence, doing research for our blog and improving on the research we use for our recommendations. If you want the chance to meet other EAs and spend two weeks gaining skills and working in a prominent EA organisation, I encourage you to apply! Note that this is an unpaid internship, and we won't be able to provide accommodation (although I can help you find something if you need help!)
