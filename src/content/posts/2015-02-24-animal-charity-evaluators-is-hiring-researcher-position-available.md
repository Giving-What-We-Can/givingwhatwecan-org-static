_This is [cross-posted](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/ace-is-hiring-researcher-position-available/) from the [Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE)](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/) [blog](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/). ACE is a US-based charity dedicated to finding and promoting the most effective ways to help animals. They do this by analysing research on methods of helping animals in order to provide research of interventions and top-charity recommendations. They offer suggestions on being a more effective animal advocate by providing career, charity, and volunteering advice, and also plan on working with other organisations to help them conduct their own research._

Update: We are offering a $1,000 donation to the animal charity of your choice if you bring us an applicant that we otherwise didn’t know about that we end up hiring for the position. Some of our best candidates in that past have come from referrals, so please think about anyone in your network who might be a good fit, and send them our way!
