It’s that time of year - we’re re-evaluating our [top charities](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities)!

Over the next weeks we’re going to release a series of blog posts for a few charities we’re currently considering recommending. This will include several charities we haven’t recommended before, as well as some that we already do. We won’t be discussing all our current top charities, however, as in most cases the relevant facts have not changed much.

Once we’ve released all the blog posts we’ll update the [Top Charities](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities) page. This is of particular interest to anyone who gives via the [Giving What We Can Trust](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/trust) - a change in our top charities will result in a change in how we distribute funds from the Trust.

The first post will be up in the next couple of days.
