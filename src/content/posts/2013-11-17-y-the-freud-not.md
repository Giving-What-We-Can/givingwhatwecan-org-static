On Thursday 21st November, at 7pm at Freud's in Oxford, Giving What We Can is launching its first joint event with The Funding Network, and simultaneously launching its Oxford Big Match Campaign, which will be matching donations up to £10,000 for AMF in the next week.

See the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/638172492880170/) for more details.

### How does it work?

#### The Charities

£10 entry is charged, which will be donated to your charity of choice, three of our [recommended charities](http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities). Representatives from each charity (taken from our to recommended charities); Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative and Project Healthy Children, will give a pitch to try and to convince the audience of their chosen cause.

The best part of it all is that this coincides with the Big Match Campaign of Giving What We Can Oxford; meaning that for every ticket sold, a sponsor has offered to match the price of that ticket! So for your £10 donation you'll be raising £20 for these charities!

#### The entertainment

Alongside this crowd-funding aspect, there will be some fantastic performances and locally famous bands, including the Oxford Gargoyles. And of course, it is Freud's which makes it a whole lot better.

If you are in or near Oxford next week. bring your friends, your colleagues and anyone else who enjoys good music and great company!
