![](/images/uploads/join-the-board-1-1024x768.jpg)[Academics Stand Against Poverty](http://academicsstand.org/) (ASAP) is seeking volunteers for one-year renewable positions on its global Board of Directors. ASAP is an international professional association focused on helping poverty researchers and teachers enhance their positive impact on severe poverty. It has chapters in Austria, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Oceania, Spain, the UK, and the United States, with hundreds of members working and studying in universities, research centers and NGOs worldwide.

The currently 8-member [Board of Directors](http://academicsstand.org/about/people/board-of-directors/) is led by ASAP President Thomas Pogge (Yale University) and oversees all aspects of ASAP operation. The Board takes guidance from a 21-member [Advisory Board](http://academicsstand.org/about/people/advisory-board/) which includes some of the world's most prominent poverty researchers and development policy and practice experts.

ASAP is expanding its Board to match expanding membership and activities. Applications are welcome from academics and practitioners who have a strong interest in helping promote positive academic impact on poverty alleviation.

If you would like to apply for one of these volunteer positions, please send a current CV and application statement of 400 words or fewer explaining your interest in one of the roles and your salient experience to Rachel Payne at rachel@academcisstand.org.
