![](/images/uploads/christmas-card-design-250px.png)Christmas can inspire giving and sharing with our loved ones. Why not expand our generosity to the neediest people in the planet? Giving to effective causes allows us to make a big difference in the lives of others. To make giving easier this Christmas, we have created a [page](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/christmas) for Christmas donations, where you can also donate in someone else's name.

Despite the consumerist frenzy it has come to be associated with, there is something beautiful about the spirit of Christmas. Spending time with the ones closest to us, giving and receiving presents, sharing in common cheerfulness - these can all be wonderful displays of love for others. Why not spread this generosity all over the world, and reach out to those who are suffering in extreme poverty?

We are in a position to give so much: we can give health, life, education, and opportunities to thrive to people all over the globe. We can make Christmas an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of people who are suffering.

And how can we make the biggest difference? One of the ways to do so is to donate to effective charities - charities which, according to a large body of research, save the most lives with a donation. In this way, the generosity inspired by Christmas can have a real impact in improving others' lives. There is no better way of expressing compassion, solidarity and love than by giving to those who need it most. This is why no Christmas gift can be better than helping others.
