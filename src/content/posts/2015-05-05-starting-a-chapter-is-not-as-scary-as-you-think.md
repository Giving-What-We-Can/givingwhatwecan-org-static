You’ll probably have come across a few posts recently about starting a Giving What We Can Chapter. It’s a highly effective action you can take and it doesn’t take very much of your time.

You might be thinking that you have to know a lot about Giving What We Can and Effective Altruism though. Maybe have a lot of contacts in the movement and your own community? Certainly be very outgoing?

Actually no. If I have managed it, I think you can too.

If you’re anything like me, setting up your own chapter really does sound daunting! But it is easier than you think. I’ve recently done it by setting up [Effective Altruism Brighton](https://www.facebook.com/groups/675412532581805/).

I won’t tell you how to do it, I’m at the very early stages. We’ve got about 30 local members signed up across various social media sites and we’ve just had our first meeting. Also there are brilliant resources out there about how to start a chapter. Just provide Giving What We Can with your name and email address and they will get in contact to [get you started](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-03-17/value-starting-chapter). Their support has been invaluable to me.

What I will say though is how easy it is to start, how it isn’t as scary as you first think and how wonderful it has been so far.

### How easy is it to start?

Sam Hilton from Effective Altruism London has written about how it takes [only 30 minutes a month](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-03-05/how-i-organise-growing-chapter-in-big-city-in-less-30-minutes-month) for him to organise the highly successful London group.

I’ve spent a little longer in part because I am still learning about effective altruism myself.

I started by joining as many related groups as I could find to see what other people had done. Just search on Facebook for Effective Altruism and Giving What We Can and you’ll find a plethora of groups and other people running great meetups. A lot of groups are listed on the [Effective Altruism Hub](http://effectivealtruismhub.com/groups) and the [Effective Altruism Wiki](http://effective-altruism.wikia.com/wiki/Effective_Altruism_Wiki#Organisations_that_identify_as_.27effective_altruist.27) . I’ve even started compiling a long list of [resources on my own blog](http://practicallyethics.com/external-resources/).

Once you have help from others it’s really easy to get started. Just follow the steps in [Sam’s post](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-03-05/how-i-organise-growing-chapter-in-big-city-in-less-30-minutes-month).

### What if no one joins?

This was a big worry for me at the start. How do I find other people who might be interested in Effective Altruism? How can I articulate the good Effective Altruism can do to others?

Don’t worry. Your new contacts in the other Effective Altruism groups will soon like your Facebook page and invite people to your group if you post it on other pages. As [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) has tagged interests people found my group without me having to do anything! In fact the majority of interest has come through Meetup.com.

As for the meet-ups themselves don’t expect to have twenty people on the first go. My first meet-up had four! But we had a really engaging conversation (as well as some silly conversations too), a nice drink in a local pub and now I have a couple of people to help me take this forward.

### Isn’t meeting strangers daunting?

It is a little bit, yes. But don’t forget you share a common interest in helping others. This is a great conversation starter. We ended up discussing everything from the environment to the death penalty, veganism to American politics.

Make sure you have a sign on your table and a smile. From there, it’s easy to get started.

Is it worth it?

We’ll have to see where Effective Altruism Brighton goes in the future and how successful it is. But for me it has already been worth it. I’ve learnt so much more about about Effective Altruism. I met lovely people both at the [Effective Altruism London group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/EALondon/) and at my own meet-up. And I’ve learnt a lot more about what is happening in my own community.

And that’s only my personal gain in the first month of planning this.

Jonathan Courtney, in charge of Outreach at Giving What We Can recently wrote about conservative estimates on [the effectiveness of local groups](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-03-17/value-starting-chapter).

He estimates that if you assume just under four hours a week of work to organise a group and that the group persuades one person to take the Giving What We Can [pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/join) to donate 10% of their income to effective charities you are raising on average $20,000 USD (£13375.25 GBP).

That is easily worth my time.
