We are looking for a Director of Development to join our team in Oxford!

### Details of the role

CEA is a young and rapidly growing charity which has grown to a £300,000 annual budget over 18 months. We are located in central Oxford and affiliated with Oxford University. As described above, in this role you'll be fundraising for both Giving What We Can and the other innovative organisation that is part of CEA - 80,000 Hours. CEA has a track record of incubating new charitable projects and is continuing to expand into new areas.

In order to meet its growth targets CEA has set the ambitious goal of raising an extra £150,000 over the next year. Currently CEA is funded primarily by 'high net worth' individuals, but also by a number of medium-sized donors and grants.

For this role we are interested in people with previous experience in fundraising, in particular the following activities:

*   Writing fundraising materials (e.g. pitching projects).
*   Grant writing.
*   Identifying, establishing and building relationships with major donors.
*   More general donor relationship management.

The ideal candidate would also have a degree, be a fast and compelling writer, cope well with stress, and be keen to work with a young team in a startup environment.

Contract details: We would be willing to pay up to £40,000, depending on experience.
