### **[Apply to be our Director of Communications.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cv0BikO2MGmnkBWz9-euTFbqHO0Ttbn-iM_KA7i5zII/viewform)**

As Director of Communications you will be raising the profile of evidence-based giving and creating thousands of prospective members for our Director of Community to follow up with.

Specifically, you would be responsible for:

*   Our mass media and social media presence
*   Maintaining and improving the content on our website, and ensuring a clear pathway for people from landing on the website, through to engaging with us and donating to effective charities.
*   Organising appealing, professional events to attract interest in cost-effective giving.
*   Working closely with the Executive Director to shape the communications strategy and branding of the organisation.

We're a small team, so you'll also have the opportunity to be involved in recruitment, fundraising, publishing our findings in the media and whatever else most interests you.

### Why work at Giving What We Can

*   _Be at the heart of an inspiring community of people who care about others and really put their passion into practice_:
    We have members all around the world, all of whom are dedicating a large part of their income to helping people in the developing world as much as they can, and supporting each other in doing so. You would be getting to know these members, answering their questions, providing support to them and helping them to help others.
*   _Work with friendly and intellectual staff:_
    You’d be working alongside a talented, interesting and highly motivated team.
*   _Meet interesting and varied people:_
    Giving What We Can shares an office with the rest of the Centre for Effective Altruism and with the Future of Humanity Institute, which is part of the University of Oxford. There are always fascinating people around, and we often hold joint seminars and training sessions, as well as many social events.

    It’s a hugely exciting place to be, and has opportunities for swiftly increasing responsibility
*   _Help the world!_

### Why apply?

This role combines great potential for impact with great potential for growth and learning. Over the past couple of years, Giving What We Can has reached millions of people with its message of committing to donate the most effective charities. By leading our outreach and media, and shaping our message, you can help to move tens of thousands of pounds to the most effective charities. As one of the key team members of a rapidly growing small organisation, you'll have a huge amount of responsibility, autonomy and room to grow.

If you work for Giving What We Can, you’ll be part of a focused team of intelligent, caring, enthusiastic colleagues who want to change the world, located in the beautiful Oxford.

### Who would it suit?

We’re looking for someone who cares deeply about alleviating extreme poverty as effectively as possible and is excited to get others on board with that aim.

You’ll need excellent written and spoken communications skills, to enjoy interacting with large numbers of people and be very conscientious.

Some examples of experience that would be especially useful include journalism and on and off-line marketing – though we’re interested in anyone who can demonstrate the skills. Also helpful would be experience with Adobe CS or equivalents, Drupal and HTML/CSS.

Candidates will be selected on the following traits, and should aim to demonstrate them in their application:

*   GMA (General Mental Ability)
*   Social skills and network
*   Robust positive self-motivation
*   Having an effective altruist mindset
    *   Altruism
    *   Focus on effectiveness
*   Writing and verbal skills
*   Relevant experience and skills.

Applications close midnight GMT on Friday the 12th December. We are offering a $1,000 reward for introductions to anyone we don’t already know who we end up hiring for the roles we are currently advertising.

We would be willing to negotiate a starting salary between £19,000 and £30,000, depending on experience.
