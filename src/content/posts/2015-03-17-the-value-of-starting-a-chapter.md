_This is cross-posted (with minor changes) from the [Effective Altruism Forum](http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/fa/the_value_of_starting_a_giving_what_we_canea/). For more advice and encouragement, read about [how to start a chapter at a university](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-02-20/why-havent-you-set-chapter-yet) and [in a big city (with minimal work!)](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-03-05/how-i-organise-growing-chapter-in-big-city-in-less-30-minutes-month) and, if you haven't already, get started!_

I think most of us in Giving What We Can have a sense that chapters are valuable, but its often hard to tell how valuable they are. Well, in this blog post, I am going to argue that they are incredibly valuable. So much so, that starting a Giving What We Can chapter could be one of the most effective things you can do with your time. Some rough calculations show that **establishing even a relatively small chapter at a university could result in producing 100,000 USD for effective charities**. Similar calculations lead me to think that time starting a community based chapter can be worth **110 USD/hour of work**. These are both incredible results, and I hope they inspire many of you to start up a new chapter!

### The Importance of Chapters

Chapters are important because they represent a natural way for Giving What We Can to grow. Given our experiences with chapters so far, we think it is reasonable to expect a new Giving What We Can Chapter to produce 3-5 new members in their first year. This represents an absolutely incredible amount of money moved to the most effective charities. Even by a conservative estimate, we should value this at $60,000-$100,000 USD moved to the most effective charities.

(We have settled on valuing the pledge at $20,000USD to accommodate counterfactual giving and possible attrition rates. This is a very conservative figure, as the median earning individual in the US will give away over $150,000USD over the course of their career through the pledge. That said, valuing the pledge quite conservatively at $20,000USD only helps to strengthen the conclusions of this post- if anything we might expect the real value of money moved to the most effective charities to be much higher than the numbers considered here)

Even if we assume that running a chapter is quite time intensive, requiring say 40 hours a month, this means that you will still be producing 120-200 dollars of value per hour of work- an incredible result! The most successful chapters do much better than this. During Cambridge’s [exceptionally successful event](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Society/article1503068.ece) this December, **over 100 individuals took the pledge** representing **over $2 million USD going to cost-effective charities**. This is an absolutely amazing result for students to be able to have, and it really shows the potential of chapters.

**If you are an EA, one of the most impactful things you can do with your time is to start a chapter.**

If we turn our attention from University chapters, to community chapters, the same incredible returns still seem to apply. Most community chapters focus their time on social events. Recently, Sam Hilton, head of the London chapter, [explained that he runs their successful chapter on only 30 minutes a month](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-03-05/how-i-organise-growing-chapter-in-big-city-in-less-30-minutes-month), which is quite an achievement!

But even if we assume that organising a community chapter will take much more time than this, it turns out to be an incredibly valuable activity. If over the course of a year your social events lead to just one person in the group taking the pledge, that represents $20,000 USD for the most cost effective charities. Lets say it takes 15 hours a month to organise these activities (30x more time than Sam’s figure). That is 180 hours of work over the course of the year producing $20,000 USD. That means you earn roughly 110 dollars/hour for the most effective charities. Just to put that in perspective, this represents the same value added, per hour, as someone earning $440,000 USD a year pursuing earning to give at 50% of their income.

Suffice to say this is an incredible fact. It clearly paints a picture of how unbelievably effective working on Effective Altruism Movement growth is, insofar as this movement growth translates into people [taking the pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/become-member).

### Start a chapter today!

I hope this post has inspired you to start a chapter at your city or at your university! As I mentioned, by starting a chapter at your university or in your city, you could move tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to the most effective charities.

In my next post, I will be addressing some of the concerns that often prevent people from starting up a chapter. One concern people often express is that they don't know how to properly start up a chapter, and feel intimated by the potential difficulty of it. Luckily, Giving What We Can has shifted our outreach strategy, in part, to try and address this concern. Our outreach strategy will now be much more Chapter focused, I will be spending most of my time communicating with current chapters, and supporting people starting out new chapters.

If you are interested in starting a chapter, please [email me](mailto:jonathan.courtney@givingwhatwecan.org) and/or [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1czOhTygsmprIaMN0CLS7jd5NVuTMlWmo8PbHnrf9I4E/viewform?usp=send_form). I will be happy to work with you - sharing best practices, directing you to other Effective Altruists in your area, and otherwise doing all that I can to help make your chapter a success!

2015 is going to be a big year for Giving What We Can - let’s make it even bigger by pursuing big wins like starting up successful chapters!
