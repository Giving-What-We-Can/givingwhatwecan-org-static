As Research analyst, you would help our efforts to find the charities which most effectively alleviate extreme poverty and advise the Giving What We Can community in their donation decisions. You would be reporting to our Director of Research, Hauke Hillebrandt.

Part of your role will be working with the ED and the Director of Research to determine what the best research strategy for GWWC is. That process will affect what the precise remit of the role is. Your strengths and interests will also determine what the focus of the role ends up being. The areas within which your activities will lie are:

*   Helping to determine which charities we should recommend – based on both the effectiveness of the interventions the charities carry out, and how well those organisations implement them
*   Understanding the broader landscape of top charitable interventions and organisations, in order to advise our members when deciding where to donate
*   Presenting the research in compelling ways in order to encourage people to donate to the most effective charities, both via our website and through presentations
*   Supervising student volunteers on their research projects
*   Help writing policy white papers

We are a small team, so you’ll also have the opportunity to be involved in recruitment, fundraising, publishing our findings in the media, and whatever else most interests you.

## Why work at Giving What We Can

*   _Be at the heart of an inspiring community of people who care about others and really put their passion into practice_: We have members all around the world, all of whom are dedicating a large part of their income to helping others as much as they can, and supporting each other in doing so. You would be getting to know these members, answering their questions, providing support to them and helping them to help others.
*   _Work with friendly and intellectual staff_: You’d be working alongside a talented, interesting and highly motivated team.
*   _Meet interesting and varied people_: Giving What We Can shares an office with the rest of the Centre for Effective Altruism and with the Future of Humanity Institute, which is part of the University of Oxford. There are always fascinating people around, and we often hold joint seminars and training sessions, as well as many social events.
*   _Be part of a fast-growing organisation and social movement_: It’s a hugely exciting place to be, and has opportunities for swiftly increasing responsibility
*   _Help the world_: Each new member of Giving What We Can saves around 10 lives, meaning that the right person in this job could help prevent over 100 unnecessary deaths each year!

## Why apply?

This role combines great potential for impact with great potential for growth and learning. In determining which charities Giving What We Can recommends, you will be influencing a rapidly expanding pool of donations, already over a million pounds each year, in order to help those in extreme poverty as much as possible. As one of the key team members of a rapidly growing small organisation, you’ll have a huge amount of responsibility, autonomy and room to grow.

If you work for Giving What We Can, you’ll be part of a focused team of intelligent, caring, enthusiastic colleagues who want to change the world, located in the centre of beautiful Oxford.

*   supervision of students’ research projects
*   science communication experience (e.g. science blogging, giving talks)

However, we’re interested in anyone who can demonstrate the skills.
