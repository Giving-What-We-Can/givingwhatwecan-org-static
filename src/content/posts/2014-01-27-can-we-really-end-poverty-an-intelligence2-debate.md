Back in December, [intelligence2](http://www.intelligencesquared.com) organized a debate on whether ending poverty is possible, and a video recording of the event is now available [online](http://www.intelligencesquared.com/events/oecd-debate-can-we-really-end-poverty/). The deadline for the first set of Millennium Development Goals is coming up in 2015, and new goals are being formulated now. The panelists discussed the progress of MDGs so far and the next set of challenges facing poverty elimination. If you ever wondered how to be smarter about aid and whether China can serve as a model for Africa or about how to get to "zero poverty" and then stay there, this is well worth a watch!
