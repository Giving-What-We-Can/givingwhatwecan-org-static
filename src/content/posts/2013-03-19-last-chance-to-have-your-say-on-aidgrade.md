Today is the last day you can vote on which topics you want AidGrade to cover next! It's your chance to steer research towards issues you think are important. There are roughly 40 options and you can choose three, AidGrade plans on covering 20 of them. The potential research areas include everything from micro health insurance to rural roads. You can find the survey [here](http://www.aidgrade.org/uncategorized/which-topics-do-you-want-us-to-cover).

And why should you vote? If you are reading this blog, you most likely care about effective aid. AidGrade, like GWWC, evaluates and recommends international development programmes on the basis of effectiveness. You can read more about what AidGrade does [here](http://www.aidgrade.org/why-aidgrade). Helping AidGrade select new topics is a great opportunity to bring more attention and donations to development issues you care about!
