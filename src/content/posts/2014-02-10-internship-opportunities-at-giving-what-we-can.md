We are currently looking for interns to join our Graduate Volunteer Scheme. This involves a period of several months' work in our Oxford-based office. Work will be varied, and prioritised by the most pressing needs in the six month plan. We are also taking applications for our two-week student development programme in September. All candidates would ideally be intelligent and hardworking, and motivated by the idea of contributing to our mission of inspiring donations to the most effective charities fighting extreme poverty.

Taking up a graduate volunteer position is a great way to gain experience for your future career as well as meet and work with a diverse range of fascinating and motivated people at the same time. There is a large amount of job flexibility, meaning that you can work on whatever is most useful and will develop your skills in a good way. It is also a great way to do good and make a positive impact.

See below for more information; details are also available on our [recruitment page](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/work-with-us).

## Long-term internships on our Graduate Volunteer Scheme

We run a Graduate Volunteer Scheme on which you can intern with us for several months. We can often provide accommodation and expenses to ensure that you're not left out of pocket. As a Graduate Volunteer, there are lots of different areas to work on, and there's plenty of flexibility to adjust the role so it plays to your strengths and development aims. We make it our responsibility to ensure your time here allows you to grow as much as possible, as well as just being lots of fun! We're looking for hardworking individuals with a strong desire for personal development who are deeply interested in making the world a better place in an effective way.

The scheme has proved very popular with our current interns, with a stimulating and dedicated atmosphere in the office and a lively and welcoming community outside office hours. Perhaps the strongest evidence of this is that many have extended their stays repeatedly. Once you have applied, we are happy to connect you with a current intern to discuss what it's like to work with us. Read more about why it's great to work at CEA [here](http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers/why-work-with-us).

Your chances of being offered an internship are greatly increased if you can secure your own funding, for example through scholarships and fundraising.
